# lyric_generator

This is a project for the Erdos Institute's NLP 2021 bootcamp. Two generative adversarial networks are tested against each other in generating metal lyrics using a data set from Kaggle. One network is the Soft-GAN (Soft_GAN.ipynb), and the other is a WGAN paired with an autoencoder network (Lyric_Generator.ipynb).
